This is an internal document.

\todo multiple-argument options
\todo code copyright laws into it since it won't extend forever
\todo long options with = like --foo=bar
\todo write a canonical rep function for opts that returns a static buffer for printf locally
\todo fix the naming of "conflicts" it should probably have a better name but hard to find a general one
